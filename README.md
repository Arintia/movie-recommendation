## Movie Recommendation App by YiÄŸit Atak

### About the project
This project is a web application that allows you to recommend movies and see the details of movies that've been suggested by the users. The application features a filter that allows you to search for movies based on genre and director, an authentication screen(this app does **NOT** have a built-in authentication system for now, it uses a fake authentication), a simple admin panel that allows you to delete and confirm recommended movies, a details page where you can see the full details of a movie, and much more. This project will likely be developed further as time goes on. Suggestions for improvement are welcome, feel free to also fork the project and work on improvements yourself if you wish. Check the to-do list down below for my current road map for this project. It utilizes an API to preserve data across multiple users and page refreshes. Currently, it doesn't utilize any DBMS so the data is lost if the API is shutdown.

### Features

### Admin Account
The current admin account is as follows;
```
Username: test
Password: 12345

```

You can easily add your own admin account. Simply navigate to the client subfolder, then to the redux subfolder, then to the movies subfolder and open up the MoviesSlice.js file. CTRL+F and type "adminAccounts" and follow the same syntax to add a new account. **IMPORTANT!** This should NOT replace an actual user auth system in a production app.
